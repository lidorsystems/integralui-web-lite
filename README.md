## Services

<b>Common</b> - Includes a set of common functions usable in most applications

<b>Data</b> - Includes a set of data related functions for different operations like: add/remove, search, etc.


## Dependencies

IntegralUI Web Lite is built on top of [LitElement](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element). All necessary files from that library are already included in the /external subfolder of this repository.


## DEMO

[Online QuickStart App](https://www.lidorsystems.com/products/web/studio/samples/web-components/) - An online demo of each component included


## Installation

Install the repository by running

```bash
npm install https://github.com/lidorsystems/integralui-web-lite.git
```

or directly from NPM

```bash
npm i @lidorsystems/integralui-web-lite
```

Open your application and add a reference to a component you want to use. For example, if you are using the IntegralUI TreeView component:</p>

### Angular

```bash
import '@lidorsystems/integralui-web-lite/components/integralui.treeview.js';
```

### React

```bash
import IntegralUITreeViewComponent from '@lidorsystems/integralui-web-lite/wrappers/react.integralui.treeview.js';
```

<b>Note</b>   Currently [ReactJS doesn't have full support for Web Components](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#react). Mainly because of the way data is passed to the component via attributes and their own synthetic event system. For this reason, you can use available wrappers located under /wrappers directory, which are ReactJS components that provide all public API from an IntegralUI component.</p>

### Vanilla JavaScript

```bash
<script type="module" src="@lidorsystems/integralui-web-lite/components/integralui.treeview.js"></script>
```


## Icons

Because of the web component specification that defines URLs to be always relative to the main document, the path that leads to the icons used by the IntegralUI Web components needs to be set. In addition you may also need to copy/paste the /icons folder in your application folder. Depending on the framework of your choosing this may differ.

### Angular

PLACEHOLDER

### React

Follow these steps:
1. Copy/Paste the content of the @lidorsystems/integralui-web-lite/icons folder under /public/integralui/icons subfolder in your React application. 
2. Set the resourcePath property of IntegralUI Web components to point to the location set in your /public folder. In this case, for TreeView for example:

```bash
<IntegralUITreeViewComponent resourcePath="integralui/icons"></IntegralUITreeViewComponent>
```

### Vanilla JavaScript

PLACEHOLDER


## QuickStart App

There is a demo application with source code that contains samples for each component included in the IntegralUI Web Lite library. It can help you to get started quickly with learning about the components and write tests immediatelly. From [IntegralUI Web Lite - QuickStart]() you can download a demo app for Angular, React and Vanilla JavaScript.

A detailed information about each of these quickstart demos is available in ReadMe file, located in the root folder of the demo app.
